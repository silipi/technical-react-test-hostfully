# Frontend (React) technical test - Hostfully 🌎🏠;

The technical test was develop using React and Redux Toolkit, along with JavaScript and Styled Components.

## Decisions:

- **JavaScript**: As the test asked for ES6, I decided to use Create React App with only JavaScript instead of TypeScript. But I can develop using TypeScript if is suited for the project (I also prefer to use it).

- **Styled Components**: As the test didn't mentioned anything about CSS in JS, I decided to use Styled Components because is widely adopted and battle-tested.

- **Redux Toolkit**: Is the best way, in my opinion, to start any new project that needs global state management as Redux, instead of the regular React + Redux. Toolkit give us the best dev-experience with TypeScript and works just fine with Sagas.

## How to run:

To start the project you need to first install the packages:

```bash
yarn # or npm install
```

Then you can run the project:

```bash
yarn start # or npm run start
```

You can also run the linting and formatting:

```bash
yarn lint # or npm run lint
yarn format # or npm run format
```
